% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{op-tical net-works semi-conduc-tor}


\begin{document}
%
% paper title
% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,
% at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to and up, which are usually
% not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title.
% Linebreaks \\ can be used within to get better formatting as desired.
% Do not put math or special symbols in the title.
%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocenumeratethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocenumeratethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.


% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.



% The paper headers
\markboth{IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing}%
{Yu \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Effective Multi-Agent Communication Under Limited Bandwidth}
% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
% 
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.



% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with
% Computer Society journal papers as those publications place the marks
% outside of the main text columns and, therefore, unlike regular IEEE
% journals, the available text space is not reduced by their presence.
% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}
% or like this to get the Computer Society new two part style.
%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society jorunal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.





% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
% \fi
%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

\section{Proof of Theorem 1}
\label{subsection:p1}

The theorem is presented below for ease of reading.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:1}
$H(M)$ decreases synchronously with $\hat{H}(M)$ for their values are closely related, i.e., 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    H(M) &< \hat{H}(M) + \frac{(K+1)\epsilon}{N_s}\left(1+\log \left(\frac{1}{K+1}+\frac{\epsilon}{N_s}\right)\right),\\
        H(M) &> \hat{H}(M)+ \frac{(K+1)\epsilon}{N_s} \log\frac{\epsilon}{N_s}. 
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{IEEEproof}
For clear expression, let
\begin{equation}
    D_k = \frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s} \log\frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s} - \frac{N_k}{N_s}\log\frac{N_k}{N_s}.
\end{equation}
According to the mean value theorem, 
\begin{equation}
    \exists u \in \left(\frac{N_k}{N_s}, \frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s}\right) \ \ s.t. \ \    D_k = \frac{\epsilon}{N_s} f'(u),
\end{equation}
where $f(u) = u\log u$ and $f'(u) = 1+\log u$. Note that $f''(u)>0$, hence
\begin{equation}
\epsilon f'(u_{min}) < D_k < \epsilon f'(u_{max}),
\end{equation}
where $u_{min}=N_k/N_s$ and $u_{max}=(N_k+\epsilon)/N_s$. Then
\begin{equation}
\frac{\epsilon}{N_s} \left(1+\log \frac{N_k}{N_s}\right) < D_k < \frac{\epsilon}{N_s} \left(1+\log \frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s}\right).
\end{equation}
The above equation provides upper and lower bounds for $D_k$. However, $\log (N_k/N_s)$ might be $-\infty$ as $N_k$ might be $0$. Therefore, we need another lower bound for $D_k$. Note that $\partial D_k/\partial N_k>0$, then 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
      \min D_k &= D_k|_{N_k=0} \\
            &=\frac{\epsilon}{N_s}\log\frac{\epsilon}{N_s},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
and consequently
\begin{equation}
\frac{\epsilon}{N_s} \log\frac{\epsilon}{N_s} \le D_k < \frac{\epsilon}{N_s} \left(1+\log \frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s}\right).
\end{equation}
Note that
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
     H(M) - \hat{H}(M)&= \sum_{k=0}^K D_k, \\
     \sum_{k=0}^{K} N_k &= N_s,
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
    H(M) - \hat{H}(M) > \frac{(K+1)\epsilon}{N_s} \log\frac{\epsilon}{N_s},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    H(M) - \hat{H}(M) < \frac{\epsilon}{N_s}\left(K+1+ \log \prod_k \frac{N_k+\epsilon}{N_s}\right).
\end{equation}
According to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means,
\begin{equation}
    H(M) - \hat{H}(M)< \frac{(K+1)\epsilon}{N_s}\left(1+\log \left(\frac{1}{K+1}+\frac{\epsilon}{N_s}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
\end{IEEEproof}

\section{Proof of Theorem 2}
\label{subsection:p2}
The theorem is presented below for ease of reading.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:2}
If $\eta$ is \textbf{sufficiently small} and $m'_n = m_n - \eta \nabla^s_{m_n}f_H$,
\begin{equation}
    f_H(m_1,...,m'_n,...,m_{N_s}) \le f_H(m_1,...,m_n,...,m_{N_s}).
\end{equation}
Here \textbf{sufficiently small} means
\begin{equation}
\label{eqa:ss}
    \eta < \frac{N_s\Delta^2}{\pi \log\frac{N_s+\epsilon}{\epsilon}}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
We present our derivation by providing two lemmas. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:1}
If $m_n \in [v\Delta-1, (v+1)\Delta-1]$, then 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $\hat{N}_{v+1} > \hat{N}_{v}$, then $m'_n > m_n$.
    \item If $\hat{N}_{v+1} < \hat{N}_{v}$, then $m'_n < m_n$.
    \item If $\hat{N}_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v}$, then $m'_n = m_n$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{IEEEproof}
  $\nabla^s_{m_n} f_H$ is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqa:defdem}
    \begin{split}
        \nabla^s_{m_n} f_H &= \nabla^s_{m_n}\left(-\sum_{k=0}^K \frac{\hat{N}_k}{N_s}\log\frac{\hat{N}_k}{N_s}\right) \\
        &= -\frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{k=0}^K\left(1+\log\frac{\hat{N}_k}{N_s}\right)\nabla^s_{m_n}\hat{N}_k \\
        &= -\frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{k=0}^K\left(1+\log\frac{\hat{N}_k}{N_s}\right)\nabla_{m_n} q_k(m_n).
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Since $m_n \in [v\Delta-1, (v+1)\Delta-1]$, only $\nabla_{m_n} q_v(m_n)$ and $\nabla_{m_n} q_{v+1}(m_n)$ remain nonzero for $\nabla_{m_n}q_k(m_n), k\in \mathbb{N}_K$. Additionally, $q_k(\cdot)$ defined below:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqa:qk}
q_k(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1+cos(\frac{\pi}{\Delta}(x-k\Delta+1)))\cdot u_k(x),
\end{equation}
satisfies:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla_{m_n} q_v(m_n) + \nabla_{m_n} q_{v+1}(m_n) = 0.
\end{equation}
Then $\nabla^s_{m_n} f_H$ is simplified as:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla^s_{m_n} f_H = \frac{1}{N_s} \log\frac{\hat{N}_{v+1}}{\hat{N}_{v}} \nabla_{m_n} q_v(m_n).
\end{equation}
Note that $q_v(m_n)$ also satisfies 
\begin{equation}
    \nabla_{m_n} q_v(m_n) \le 0, \ \ \forall m_n\in [v\Delta-1, (v+1)\Delta-1],
\end{equation}
therefore, the sign of the derivative is determined by $\log(\hat{N}_{v+1}/\hat{N}_{v})$. Consequently, we obtain Lemma~\ref{lemma:1}.
\end{IEEEproof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:2}
If $m_n$ is updated to $m'_n$ with a \textbf{sufficiently small} step size $\eta$: 
\begin{equation}
    m'_n = m_n - \eta \nabla^s_{m_n} f_H,
\end{equation}
then for $\hat{N}_k, k\in\mathbb{N}_K$ obtained by 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{N}_k = \epsilon + \sum_{n=1}^{N_s} \hat{w}_k(m_n),
\end{equation}
only $\hat{N}_v$ and $\hat{N}_{v+1}$ might be changed, whose new values are denoted by $\hat{N}'_v$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1}$. 

To be specific, if $\hat{N}_v > \hat{N}_{v+1}$, the update leads to only two consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v +1$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1} -1$.
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1}$.
\end{enumerate}

Similarly, if $\hat{N}_v < \hat{N}_{v+1}$, the update leads to only two consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v - 1$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1} + 1$.
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}


\begin{IEEEproof}
Note that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \max\left|\nabla^s_{m_n} f_H\right| &= \max\left|\frac{1}{N_s}\nabla_{m_n} q_v(m_n)\log\frac{\hat{N}_{v+1}}{\hat{N}_{v}}\right|, \\
    &= \frac{1}{N_s} \frac{\pi}{2\Delta} \log\frac{N_s+\epsilon}{\epsilon}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Since $\eta$ is \textbf{sufficiently small} as is defined in (\ref{eqa:ss}),  $\max|\eta\nabla^s_{m_n} f_H| <0.5\Delta$. Then 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    &\forall v\in \mathbb{N}_K, \forall m_n\in [v\Delta-1, (v+1)\Delta-1] \\
    &m'_n\in [(v-0.5)\Delta-1, (v+1.5)\Delta-1].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Therefore, only $\hat{N}_v$ and $\hat{N}_{v+1}$ might be changed by the update of $m_n$. 

To be specific, if $\hat{N}_v > \hat{N}_{v+1}$, then $m'_n<m_n$, and the update leads to two consequences: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the quantized $m_n$ changes: $m^{\Delta}_n \neq m'^{\Delta}_n$, which means $m^{\Delta}_n = (v+1)\Delta-1$ and $m'^{\Delta}_n = v\Delta-1$, then $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v +1 $ and  $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1} - 1$.
    \item if the quantized $m_n$ remains the same, then $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v $ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1}$. 
\end{enumerate}

If $\hat{N}_v < \hat{N}_{v+1}$, the proof is similar.
\end{IEEEproof}
With the help of the above two lemmas, Theorem~\ref{theorem:2} can be proved as follows.

\newpage
\begin{IEEEproof}
For convenience, we use $f_H$ to denote $f_H(m_0,...,m_n,...)$ and $f'_H$ to denote $f_H(m_0,...,m'_n,...)$. $f'_H - f_H$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f'_H - f_H &= \frac{\hat{N}_v}{N_s}\log\frac{\hat{N}_v}{N_s} + \frac{\hat{N}_{v+1}}{N_s}\log\frac{\hat{N}_{v+1}}{N_s} \\ &- \frac{\hat{N}'_v}{N_s}\log\frac{\hat{N}'_v}{N_s} - \frac{\hat{N}'_{v+1}}{N_s}\log\frac{\hat{N}'_{v+1}}{N_s}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

There are three possibilities about the values of $\hat{N}_v$, $\hat{N}_{v+1}$, $\hat{N}'_v$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v$ and $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1}$. In this case, $f'_H - f_H = 0$.
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v + 1$, $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1} -1$ and $\hat{N}_v>\hat{N}_{v+1}$. In this case, we use $x_1$ to denote $\hat{N}_{v}/N_s$, $x_2$ to denote $\hat{N}_{v+1}/N_s$, $\psi$ to denote $1/N_s$ and define $f(x) = x\log x$. Then 
\begin{equation}
    f'_H - f_H = f(x_1)+f(x_2)-f(x_1+\psi)-f(x_2-\psi),
\end{equation}
where $x_1>x_2$. According to the mean value theorem,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &\exists x'_1\in (x_1, x_1+\psi) \ \ s.t. \ \ f(x_1+\psi) = f(x_1)+\psi f'(x'_1), \\
        &\exists x'_2\in (x_2-\psi, x_2) \ \ s.t. \ \ f(x_2-\psi) = f(x_2)-\psi f'(x'_2).
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}
    f'_H - f_H = \psi f'(x'_2) - \psi f'(x'_1).
\end{equation}
Since $f''(x)>0,\forall x \in (0,1)$ and $x'_2<x_2<x_1<x'_1$, it is obvious that $f'(x'_2)<f'(x'_1)$. Therefore, in this case, $f'_H - f_H < 0$
    \item $\hat{N}'_v = \hat{N}_v - 1$, $\hat{N}'_{v+1} = \hat{N}_{v+1} +1$ and $\hat{N}_v<\hat{N}_{v+1}$. Similarly, $f'_H - f_H < 0$ in this case.
\end{enumerate}

And finally we have $f'_H \leq f_H$.
